I am an AI researcher interested in neurosymbolic methods and sequence modeling, especially where structure and learning interact. I have research experience in constraint programming and Transformer-based sequence generation, applied AI experience from RL pathfinding work at Ubisoft.

# Other interests
<p style="text-align: justify">I've loved music since I started piano at six years old, especially Chopin, Debussy, Liszt, Beethoven, Eugénie Rocherolle, and André Mathieu.
I escape in books, and I am always up for some ice skating, a tennis match or a swim.</p>
